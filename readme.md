IMPORTANT: 
To run the CUDA prototype, execute "make DEF=-DNVIDIA_DESKTOP" if your desktop x session uses the nvidia graphics card, otherwise it will get stuck after opening the window
otherwise, if you want the raymarcher to run and your desktop isnt rendered with the nvidia card by default, just execute make without it

Running main.c will create an explorable 3d sdf based environment, you will have to press the space bar to go up for a second to exit the ground.
